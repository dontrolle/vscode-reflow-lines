`{"settings": {"preferredLineLength":80, "doubleSpaceBetweenSentences": true, "resizeHeaderDashLines": true, "wrapLongLinks":"wrap"}}`

This markdown file is used by the getReflowedText_compare_before_and_after unit test.  The test reads the *befor.md* file and iteratively
performs a reflow operation on all lines it finds and compares each result to the corresponding lines in the *after.md* file.
The very first line in this file is a special *settings* line that specifies the ReflowMarkdown extension settings via an inline code block of JSON.
Similar lines occur further down in the file and when each is encountered the specified settings are merged in and used
for reflowing until another *settings* line is encountered. As changes to the code are made, this method of testing will tell us if
we have made any changes that cause the before and after paragraphs to no longer match.

This is a Longer Header Made Using Equals Signs Which Wraps At 30 Characters

`{"settings": {"preferredLineLength":70 }}`

This is a Header Made With Dashes And It is Exactly 70 Characters Long

1. This is the first item in a list.
2. This is the second item in a list and it is much longer.  It is so long that it extends beyond the preferredLineLength.

   > This is a blockquote paragraph that extends beyond the preferredLineLength of 70 characters.
   > After this blockqote is reflowed, each line should not be longer than 70 characters

`{"settings": {"doubleSpaceBetweenSentences":false }}`

This is a paragraph with several sentences.  It starts out with two or more spaces between each sentence.    When it 
is reflowed, we expect there to only be one space between the sentences!    Does it work with questions too?
My response to that is "yes it does."           The github user [rbolsius](https://github.com/rbolsius) [recommended this feature](https://github.com/marvhen/ReflowMarkdown/pull/1) 
and I said "awesome!"    You may ask "does it work when a sentence ends like this?"  Yes, it does.However, if you forget to put at least one space between sentences like this, it does not know that that you wanted a new sentence to start, so it will not add any spacing for you.

[This line ends is a very long link/url and it does not get reflowed to the next line](http://some-long-url.blah.blah?q=abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz)

This [line ends with a very long link/url and it reflows to the next line but then it doesn't wrap anymore after that.](http://some-long-url.blah.blah?q=abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz)

`{"settings": {"wrapLongLinks":"doNotWrap" }}`

This [line ends with a very long link/url and it does not reflow to the next line because we have wrapLongLinks set to doNotWrap](http://some-long-url.blah.blah?q=abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz)
